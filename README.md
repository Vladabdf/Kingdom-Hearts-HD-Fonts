# Kingdom Hearts HD Fonts
I will be sharing fonts I create here. All fonts are made to as closely as possible replicate official fonts used within the KH HD games, including KH, KH2, BbS, ReCoM, DDD, 0.2, and KH3. All fonts will aim to have all or most Latin-based characters fully made and ready to use in any context, as well as various other alphabets such as Greek and Cyrillic, and even full-width Latin characters in addition to other full-width Japanese characters.
Tl;dr, fonts will try to be indiscriminate to whatever keyboard you have!

The first font made is the KH2 HD font used in various menus and gameplay, such as the Command Menu, camp menu, save/load screen, etc.
